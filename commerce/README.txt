This demo auction site was my first Django project. On this site, there is the functionality to register a user account, add listings, add/view your wishlist, as well as bid and comment on other listings.

To run, youâ€™ll need to: 
Set-up a virtual environment (virtualenv).
Install python to your environment
Install django to your environment

Run the following commands:
